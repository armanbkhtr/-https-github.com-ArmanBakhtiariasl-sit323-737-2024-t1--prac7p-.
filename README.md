Below are the detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up a Kubernetes cluster, creating a Docker image, deploying it to Kubernetes, and creating a Kubernetes service. Please ensure you have the required tools and prerequisites mentioned in the question before proceeding.

Step 1: Setup the Kubernetes Cluster
Install Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
Download and install kubectl from https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/ based on your operating system.
Install Docker
Download and install Docker from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ based on your operating system.
Set up a Kubernetes Cluster
If using a local environment, install Minikube (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) or Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled.
For cloud-based clusters, use services like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, or Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Configure kubectl
Connect kubectl to your Kubernetes cluster using appropriate commands or configuration files based on your cluster type (local or cloud).
Step 2: Create the Docker Image
Install Node.js
Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ based on your operating system.
Set up your Node.js application
Create your Node.js application code or use an existing one.
Create a Dockerfile
In your application directory, create a Dockerfile specifying dependencies, ports, and commands needed to run your application.
Build the Docker Image
Open terminal/command prompt in your application directory.
Run docker build -t your-image-name:tag . to build your Docker image.
Step 3: Create the Kubernetes Deployment
Define Deployment YAML
Create a deployment.yaml file defining your application's deployment settings like image, replicas, ports, etc.
Apply Deployment
Use kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml to deploy your application to Kubernetes.
Verify deployment status using kubectl get deployments and kubectl get pods commands.
Step 4: Create the Kubernetes Service
Define Service YAML
Create a service.yaml file defining your application's service settings like type, ports, selectors, etc.
Apply Service
Use kubectl apply -f service.yaml to create a Kubernetes service for your application.
Verify service creation using kubectl get services command.
By following these steps, you can successfully set up a Kubernetes cluster, create a Docker image, deploy it to Kubernetes, and create a Kubernetes service for your microservice application. Adjust configurations and settings as per your application requirements and cluster environment.
